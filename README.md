# Online Garage Sale
###### By: Thomas Walsh, Neha Patel, and Evan Konermann
## Purpose
OGS is similar to an online garage sale where users can upload items they are selling and can purchase items others are selling. On the home page we will have a “featured sellers” section that constantly updates the top sellers as well as a “Search the Pile” section where users are randomly shown random items recently uploaded. With this website, we want to create a platform where users can easily sell and buy used items. We are using HTML and CSS to properly implement this.

## How To Run
To be completely honest this project is not worth the setup required to run it. This is meant to be a live website hosted on a server. Our MySQL database would be hosted on this server and that would allaw you to interact with it. We have decided that we will not be launching this product as a website so in order to test it you will need to start an Apache server, create a MySQL database on that server with the correct names and attributes, and run all these files on that server. I will provide a detailed guide on how to go about this for anyone interested.

## Week 10
In order to run Week 10 you must install the "live server" extension for VS Code. Select the repository and click go live. Then open the XML file in the Week 10 folder.
